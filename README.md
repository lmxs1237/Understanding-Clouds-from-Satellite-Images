# Understanding-Clouds-from-Satellite-Images

This repo is for the final project of Fall 2019 EECS 6893 BIG DATA ANALYTICS course in Columbia University, contributed by Hongbo Du(hd2452), Jiajia Chen(jc5029), Yuqin Xu(yx2478).  


## Objective
<ul>
<li>Shallow clouds is an important indication of Earthâ€™s climate. However, they are difficult to represent in climate models due to various and murky organizations.</li>
<li>Build better models to classify cloud organization patterns. And understand how clouds will shape our future climate.</li>
</ul>

## Main System
<ul>
<li>Python, Spark SQL: preprocess data </li>
<li>GCP compute engine, U-Net: Image Segmentation Model</li>
<li>Flask, Google Data Studio, BigQuery: Interactive  Website</li>
</ul>
